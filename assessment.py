    This function should take a single string and return a dictionary
    that has all of the distinct words as keys, and the number of
    times that word appears in the string as values.

    For example::

        >>> print_dict(count_words("each word appears once"))
        {'appears': 1, 'each': 1, 'once': 1, 'word': 1}

    Words that appear more than once should be counted each time::

        >>> print_dict(count_words("rose is a rose is a rose"))
        {'a': 2, 'is': 2, 'rose': 3}

    It's fine to consider punctuation part of a word (e.g., a comma
    at the end of a word can be counted as part of that word) and
    to consider differently-capitalized words as different::

def kids_game(names):

    Given a list of names, like::

      bagon baltoy yamask starly nosepass kalob nicky

    Do the following:

    1. Always start with the first word ("bagon", in this example).

    2. Add it to the results.

    3. Use the last letter of that word to look for the next word.
       Since "bagon" ends with n, find the *first* word starting
       with "n" in our list --- in this case, "nosepass".

    4. Add "nosepass" to the results, and continue. Once a word has
       been used, it can't be used again --- so we'll never get to
       use "bagon" or "nosepass" a second time.

    5. When you can't find an unused word to use, you're done!
       Return the list of output words.

    For example::

        >>> kids_game(["bagon", "baltoy", "yamask", "starly",
        ...            "nosepass", "kalob", "nicky", "booger"])

    (After "baltoy", there are no more y-words, so we end, even
    though "nicky" and "booger" weren't used.)

    This is a tricky problem. In particular, think about how using
    a dictionary (with the super-fast lookup they provide) can help;
    good solutions here will definitely require a dictionary.
